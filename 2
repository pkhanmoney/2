#QUESTION 1

#imported data into R

#changing the name of the data
dataset <- DA2_q1

#creating scatterplot to visualize how different levels of 
#introspection predict different levels of optimism
ggplot(dataset, aes(x = Introspection, y = Optimism)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Impact of Introspection on Optimism",
       x = "Introspection",
       y = "Optimism") +
  theme_classic() 

#computing mean and SD for introspection and optimism 

mean_introspection <- mean(dataset$Introspection)
sd_introspection <- sd(dataset$Introspection)
mean_optimism <- mean(dataset$Optimism)
sd_optimism <- sd(dataset$Optimism)

#printing the means and SDs
mean_introspection 
sd_introspection 
mean_optimism 
sd_optimism 

#computing pearson's correlation between introspection and optimism 
cor(dataset$Introspection, dataset$Optimism, method=c("pearson"))

#interpretting the data
#what does this correlation suggest? Strength and direction?
#A 0.1683 correlation suggests a weak and positive relationship between 
#introspection and optimism. 
#introspection does not seem like a strong predictor of optimism according to this data

#QUESTION 2

#imported new data into R

#changing the name of the data
dataset2 <- DA2_q2

#1. computing pearson's correlation between organizational self rating and friends
cor(dataset2$org, dataset2$friends, method=c("pearson"))

#interpretting the data
#2. what does this correlation suggest? Strength and direction?
#A -0.1536 correlation suggests a weak and negative relationship between 
#the partipant's organizational self rating and the number of friends they have
#organizational self rating does not seem like a strong predictor of number of friends
#according to this data

#3. creating two new variables that relist org and friends in rank order
dataset2$org_ranked <-rank(dataset2$org) 
dataset2$friends_ranked <-rank(dataset2$friends) 


#4. What do you anticipate about a Spearmanâ€™s correlation analysis? 
#Do you think it will be similar or different to Pearson correlation?
#i think both correlations with be similar. spearman's correlation is non-parametric
#so is less sensitive to outliers and captures non-linear relationships because 
#the data is pretty linear and there aren't any extreme outliers i assume that 
#the spearman's correlation will also be weak and negative

#5. caluculated spearman's correlation using ranked variables: -0.1607143
cor(dataset2$org_ranked, dataset2$friends_ranked)

#caluculated spearman's correlation using original variables: 
cor(dataset2$org, dataset2$friends, method = "spearman")

#Are the two values the same? Why do you get the same number? 
#the two variables are the same. we get the same number because both 
#functions are running the same test. the first one we chose to rank 
#the variables ourselves, whereas in the second code, R did it for us

#6. How does our spearman's correlation compare to our pearson's?
#both correlations are weak and negative.Spearman's correlation may offer a more insight
#because it considers ranks, making it less sensitive to outliers and non-linear patterns

#7. creating a scatter plot of the data
ggplot(dataset2, aes(x = org, y = friends)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Impact of Organizational Self Rating on Number of Friends",
       x = "Organizational Self Rating",
       y = "Friends") +
  theme_classic() 

#the plot shows a very weak correlation. the points on the plot do not seem to
#have a strong pattern. they are scattered about. there does seem to be a small 
#negative association too because the points seem to be ascending from the left side 
#of the plot. it is barely noticeable though
